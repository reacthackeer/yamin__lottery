                <Text mb={4}>
                    We stop selling lottery tickets at 11:30 PM. After calculating the collected amount, we purchase the prizes and conduct the draw at 11:59 PM. Prizes are purchased starting from the lowest price to the highest, using the collected amount. The first name drawn receives the most valuable prize, and prizes are distributed accordingly.
